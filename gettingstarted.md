This is a tutorial on how to create a minimal gitbook with github integration. This workflow will set up a gitbook from an existing github repository, this way the webhooks enabling syncing get automatically created and you can edit your book from the the github or gitbook.com end.


##Step 1: github

Create a github repository...[](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)

* When you create a github repository you can choose a customised gitbook `.gitignore` file. 
* Add a license if one of the default options is suitable
* Click `create repository`
* Make sure to add a readme.md file (add readme button)

The repository’s main README.md is going to be the book’s introduction.

##Step 2: gitbook.com

##Step 3: Adding content


##Step 3: Configuration and plugins

Create a book.json in the project’s root. This is used by Gitbook for its settings.
